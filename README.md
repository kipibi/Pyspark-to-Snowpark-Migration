# Pyspark to Snowpark Python Migration

## What is Snowpark?
Snowpark at its core provides an API that developers can use to construct DataFrames that are executed lazily on Snowflake’s platform. It enables data engineers, data scientists, and developers coding in languages other than SQL such as Scala, Java and Python to take advantage of Snowflake’s powerful platform without having to first move data out of Snowflake. This enables data application developers to run complex transformations within Snowflake while taking advantage of the built-in unlimited scalability, performance, governance and security features.
